# H1 Calculation of solar input for solar water heating

Aperture area of solar collector, m2|(H1)
If only the gross area can be established reliably, multiply it by ratio in Table H1|

a* = 0.892 (a1 + 45 a2) or a* from Table H1|(H3b)
Collector performance ratio a*/η0 (H3b) ÷ (H2) = |(H4)

UK Region index|(H5a)
Collector Orientation|(H5b)
Collector Inclination|(H5c)
|
Annual solar radiation per m2 from U3.3 in Appendix U for the orientation and tilt of the collector|(H5) 
Overshading factor from Table H2|(H6)
Solar energy available (H1) × (H2) × (H5) × (H6) = |(H7)
Solar-to-load ratio (H7) ÷ ∑ (45)m = |(H8)
if a WWHRS is fitted this becomes (H7) ÷ [∑ (45)m – ∑Sm], see Appendix G|
Utilisation factor if (H8) > 0, 1 - exp[-1/(H8)], otherwise enter “0” in box (H9)|(H9)
if the cylinder is heated by a boiler and there is no cylinderstat, reduce the utilisation factor by 10%|
Collector performance factor f1: if (H4) < 20 0.97 - 0.0367 × (H4) + 0.0006 × (H4)^2 = <br> else 0.693 – 0.0108 × (H4) = |(H10)
Dedicated solar storage volume, Vs, litres|(H11)
volume of pre-heat store, or dedicated solar volume of a combined cylinder|
If combined cylinder, total volume of cylinder, litres|(H12)
Effective solar volume, Veff|(H13)
if separate pre-heat solar storage, (H13) = (H11)|
if combined cylinder, (H13) = (H11) + 0.3 × [(H12) – (H11)]|
Daily hot water demand, Vd,average, (litres) (H14) = (43)|(H14)
Volume ratio Veff/Vd,average (H13) ÷ (H14) = |(H15)
Solar storage volume factor f2 1 + 0.2 × ln(H15) = 
<br>(not greater than 1.0)|(H16)
Annual solar input Qs (kWh) (H7) × (H9) × (H10) × (H16) = |(H17)
